Build and flash Gleam projects to devices running [AtomVM](https://atomvm.org).

![A video showcasing the 'orbital' workflow:
The command 'gleam run -m orbital flash esp32 --port /dev/tty.usbserial001'
is ran in a terminal window.
After a short while the message 'Done' is displayed and the command
'screen' is ran to show that the code was flashed and is running on an esp device

Add it to your project as a dev dependency:

```sh
gleam add --dev orbital
```

Your project must have a module with a `start` function that takes no arguments:

```gleam
import gleam/io

pub fn start() {
  io.println("Hello, from AtomVM!")
}
```

To build and flash it to a device with the AtomVM firmware installed you can
run:

```sh
gleam run -m orbital flash esp32
gleam run -m orbital monitor
gleam run -m orbital erase-flash
```

`flash` reads the device partition table and writes the application at the
`main.avm` address. Pass `--offset 0x2b8000` to choose an address yourself.
Esptool auto-detects the serial port; pass `--port /dev/some_device` when more
than one board is connected.

`monitor` reads the serial console for 10 seconds. `--timeout 0` reads until
Ctrl+C, pressed twice. The port is chosen when only one USB serial device is
connected.

`erase-flash` wipes the entire flash of a connected ESP32. Pass `--port` when
more than one board is connected.

And you're good to go! To get an overview of all the available commands and
options you can run:

```sh
gleam run -m orbital help
```

## FAQ

- **What's AtomVM?**

  AtomVM is a lightweight implementation of the BEAM, optimized to run on tiny
  micro-controllers. You can read more about it [here!](https://atomvm.org)

- **How can I install AtomVM?**

  To install AtomVM on a device check the
  [getting started guide.](https://doc.atomvm.org/latest/getting-started-guide.html)

- **Can I run any Gleam program on AtomVM?**

  AtomVM implements a constrained subset of the Erlang's standard library, so if
  your Gleam code or dependencies use some of the functions that are not
  supported you will see a runtime error once running it on the device!

  If you see an `undef` error in your stack trace, that most likely means your
  code used one such function.

- **What can I do to help?**

  AtomVM is a wicked cool project, enabling developers to run Erlang, Elixir and
  Gleam code on tiny embedded devices, as cheap as 2$!
